## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.

BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

Company wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
Using Multiple Linear Regression model and with feature elimination, we can say that below variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
Positive correlation of below variables:
* yr                        
* workingday                
* windspeed                
* spring                   
* summer                   
* winter                   
* Jan                     
* Sept                      
* Sat                       
* Light Snow, Light Rain   
* Mist + Cloudy
